# 🚨 BRAND ASSETS REQUIRED

## Current Issue

Your designs are missing critical brand elements because **NO ASSETS HAVE BEEN UPLOADED** to your brand kit!

### What's Missing:

❌ **No Logo** - Database shows 0 logo assets
❌ **No Product Images** - No images uploaded
❌ **No Brand Photos** - No character/lifestyle images
❌ **Fonts partially configured** - Typography data exists but no font files uploaded

### What's Working:

✅ **Brand Colors** - Full palette in database:
  - Primary: #2563EB (blue)
  - Secondary: #7C3AED (purple)
  - Accent: #F59E0B (orange)
  - Text: #1F2937 (dark gray)
  - Background: #FFFFFF (white)

✅ **Brand Tokens** - Structure exists in database

## 🔧 How to Fix

### Step 1: Upload Logo

1. Go to "Onboard Brand Kit" page
2. Upload your logo file (PNG with transparent background recommended)
3. System will store in database and use in designs

### Step 2: Upload Brand Assets

Upload these asset types:
- **Logo variants** (primary, white, black, icon-only)
- **Product images** (PNG/JPG of your products)
- **Brand photos** (lifestyle images, team photos, etc.)
- **Icons/graphics** (brand-specific visual elements)

### Step 3: Upload Brand Fonts (Optional)

Upload your brand font files:
- Heading font (.ttf or .otf)

## 🎨 What Will Change

### Before (Current):

## 🚀 Next Steps

2. **3-5 product images** - Your key products/services
3. **2-3 lifestyle photos** - People using your product/service
4. **Brand fonts** - Heading + body fonts

This will enable the system to create **diverse, on-brand designs** across all your marketing channels!
