## How It Works

### 1. You Type a Prompt
```
"Launch new iPhone - premium tech aesthetic"
```

### 2. System Analyzes
- Keywords: "launch", "premium", "tech"
- Brand colors from your PDF: #1A1A2E, #0F3460
- Selects: **Glassmorphism template** ‚úÖ

### 3. Generates HTML/CSS
```html
<div class="glass-card">
    <h1 style="color: #1A1A2E">iPhone 15 Pro</h1>
    <p>Premium tech at its finest</p>
    <button style="background: #0F3460">Buy Now</button>
</div>
```

With beautiful CSS:
```css
.glass-card {
    background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15);
    backdrop-filter: blur(20px);
    border-radius: 32px;
    box-shadow: 0 20px 60px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
}
```

### 4. Renders to PNG
- Playwright opens headless browser
- Renders HTML/CSS pixel-perfect
- Captures screenshot as PNG
- Returns beautiful image! üé®

### 5. Quality Scores It
- Checks readability: 95/100 ‚úÖ
- Checks brand consistency: 90/100 ‚úÖ
- Checks accessibility: 100/100 ‚úÖ
- **Overall: 92/100** üéâ

### Check Template Availability
```bash
python3 << 'EOF'
from app.core.html_designer import HTMLDesigner, PLAYWRIGHT_AVAILABLE
from app.core.brand_brain import BrandTokens

tokens = BrandTokens(
    color={'primary': '#000', 'secondary': '#666', 'accent': '#F00'},
    typography={},
    layout={},
    cta_whitelist=[]
)

designer = HTMLDesigner(tokens)
print(f"‚úÖ Templates loaded: {len(designer.templates)}")
