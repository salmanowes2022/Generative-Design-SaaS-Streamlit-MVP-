# HTML Template Fix - Applied ✅

**Date:** October 23, 2025
**Issue:** HTML templates had broken placeholder syntax
**Status:** FIXED

---

## Problem

The HTML templates were using Python f-string syntax inside template strings:
```python
# BROKEN:
{logo_url and f'<img src="{logo_url}" class="logo">' or ''}
```

This caused:
- Ugly rendering
- Text showing literal Python code
- Broken layouts

---

## Solution

Changed to double-brace placeholders and manual replacement:

```python
# FIXED:
# In template HTML:
{{logo_html}}

# In _build_html method:
logo_html = f'<img src="{logo_url}" class="logo">' if logo_url else ''
html = template.html_template.replace('{{logo_html}}', logo_html)
```

---

## What Was Fixed

### 1. All 5 HTML Templates
- Hero with Gradient ✅
- Minimal Card ✅
- Product Showcase ✅
- Story Immersive ✅
- Glassmorphism Modern ✅

### 2. Placeholder System
- Changed from `{...}` to `{{...}}`
- Use `.replace()` instead of `.format()`
- Properly handles optional elements (logo, product image)
