## 💻 Technical Details

### **Layout System:**

```python
# Centered, vertical rhythm layout
center_y = height // 2

# Headline above center
headline_y = center_y - headline_h - 60

# Subhead below center
subhead_y = center_y + 40

# CTA button near bottom
button_y = height - 150
```

### **Typography Hierarchy:**

```python
headline_size = 96   # Large, bold, impossible to miss
subhead_size = 42    # Medium, readable
cta_size = 36        # Prominent button text
```

### **Smart Text Wrapping:**

```python
# Prefers 2-3 lines max
# Splits words intelligently
# Respects max_width
# Returns clean wrapped text
```

### **Gradient Generation:**

```python
# Diagonal gradient (top-left to bottom-right)
ratio = (x / width + y / height) / 2

# Smooth color interpolation
r = start_r + (end_r - start_r) * ratio
```
