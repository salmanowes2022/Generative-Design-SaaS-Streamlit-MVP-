# Brand Intelligence System - Deep Brand Understanding

## Overview

Your AI design agent now has **DEEP BRAND INTELLIGENCE** - it analyzes your past designs using GPT-4 Vision to truly understand and replicate your brand's visual DNA.

## How It Works

### 1. Deep Brand Analysis (New!)

When you have approved past designs, the system:

#### **Visual Analysis with GPT-4 Vision**
- Analyzes each past design image in extreme detail
- Extracts composition patterns, color usage, typography style
- Identifies your brand's unique visual signature
- Calculates confidence scores based on example count

#### **Pattern Synthesis**
- Finds consistent patterns across multiple examples
- Creates "Brand DNA" profile with:
  - Layout preferences (centered, asymmetric, grid-based, etc.)
  - Color patterns and combinations
  - Typography style and hierarchy
  - Visual style keywords
  - Background treatment preferences

#### **Actionable Guidelines**
- Generates specific rules for new designs
- Creates DALL-E prompt templates that match your style
- Lists what to include and what to avoid
- Provides background and subject treatment guides

### 2. Brand-Aware Generation Flow

### 3. Key Components

#### **Brand Analyzer** (`app/core/brand_analyzer.py`)
- **`analyze_brand_examples()`**: Deep vision analysis of past designs
- **`_analyze_single_image()`**: Per-image detailed analysis
- **`_synthesize_patterns()`**: Cross-example pattern extraction
- **`_generate_guidelines()`**: Actionable design rules
- **`get_brand_analysis_for_generation()`**: Real-time analysis for new requests

#### **Enhanced Prompt Builder** (`app/core/prompt_builder.py`)
- Now accepts `brand_analysis` parameter
- Uses AI-generated brand-aware prompts when available
- Falls back to template-based prompts with extracted patterns
- Incorporates:
  - Visual style DNA
  - Color patterns from analysis
  - Background style preferences
  - Composition rules
  - Brand signature elements

#### **Enhanced Design Agent** (`app/core/design_agent.py`)
- Performs deep brand analysis before planning
- Passes brand DNA to planning prompt
- Includes brand insights in design decisions
- Logs analysis confidence and example count

## Confidence Scoring

The system calculates confidence based on available examples:

| Examples | Confidence | Meaning |
|----------|------------|---------|
| 0 | 0% | No examples - uses brand kit only |
| 1 | 30% | Limited data - basic patterns |
| 2 | 50% | Some patterns emerging |
| 3 | 70% | Good pattern confidence |
| 4-5 | 90% | High confidence in brand DNA |

## Example Analysis Output

When analyzing past designs, you get:

```json
{
  "synthesis": {
    "brand_signature": "Minimalist product photography with pastel backgrounds, centered composition, negative space emphasis",
    "visual_style_dna": {
      "keywords": ["minimalist", "clean", "pastel", "soft-lighting", "centered"]
    },
    "color_dna": {
      "palette": ["#F5E6D3", "#E8D5C4", "#C9ADA7"],
      "usage_pattern": "Muted, warm pastels as backgrounds"
    },
    "layout_dna": {
      "rules": ["centered composition", "1/3 subject 2/3 negative space", "bottom-right logo placement"]
    }
  },
  "guidelines": {
    "background_style": "Soft pastel gradient, minimal, clean",
    "subject_treatment": "Centered, well-lit product with soft shadows",
    "must_include": ["negative space", "soft lighting", "pastel tones"],
    "must_avoid": ["busy backgrounds", "harsh shadows", "saturated colors"]
  }
}
```

## How to Get Maximum Benefit

### Step 1: Upload Brand Examples
1. Go to **Library** page
2. Upload 3-5 of your best past designs
3. Mark them as "approved" (the system learns from approved designs)

### Step 2: System Learns Automatically
- Brand Analyzer studies each image with GPT-4 Vision
- Extracts visual patterns and brand signature
- Creates design guidelines automatically

### Step 3: Generate Brand-Consistent Designs
- Chat with the AI agent
- System automatically applies brand DNA
- Generates images that match your style

## Technical Details

### GPT-4 Vision Analysis
- Model: `gpt-4o` (latest vision model)
- Detail level: **HIGH** for maximum analysis depth
- Analyzes:
  - Composition & layout structure
  - Color palette & proportions
  - Typography & hierarchy
  - Brand element placement
  - Visual style & mood
  - Technical quality

### Prompt Enhancement
- Brand-aware prompts include:
  - Style keywords from analysis
  - Color palette guidance
  - Background style preferences
  - Subject treatment rules
  - Brand signature elements
  - Composition rules
  - Must-avoid items

### Integration Points

**In Design Agent:**
```python
# Step 1: Analyze brand
brand_analysis = brand_analyzer.get_brand_analysis_for_generation(
    org_id=org_id,
    user_request=user_request
)

# Step 2: Plan with brand DNA
plan = plan_design(org_id, intent, brand_kit_id)
# Plan now includes brand analysis insights

# Step 3: Generate with brand-aware prompt
# Prompt automatically incorporates brand DNA
```

## Logs to Monitor

When generating designs, watch for these log messages:

```
INFO - Performing deep brand analysis for org {org_id}
INFO - Found {N} examples for deep analysis
INFO - Brand analysis confidence: {X}%
INFO - Using AI-generated brand-aware prompt from deep analysis
INFO - Successfully analyzed example {N}
```

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Learn from user feedback (already implemented in brand_memory.py)
- [ ] A/B testing of brand variations
- [ ] Industry-specific pattern recognition
- [ ] Seasonal style adaptation
- [ ] Multi-brand management

## Benefits

✅ **True Brand Consistency** - AI understands and replicates your visual style
✅ **Learning System** - Gets better with more examples
✅ **Automatic Analysis** - No manual rule configuration needed
✅ **Context-Aware** - Adapts to different design types while staying on-brand
✅ **Transparent** - See confidence scores and reasoning

## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Generated designs don't match brand style
- **Solution**: Add more approved examples (aim for 4-5)
- **Check**: Review brand analysis confidence score

**Problem**: Low confidence score
- **Solution**: Upload diverse examples (different layouts, use cases)

**Problem**: Analysis failing
- **Check**: Ensure images are accessible via public URLs
- **Check**: Verify OpenAI API key has access to GPT-4 Vision

## API Endpoints (for developers)

```python
from app.core.brand_analyzer import brand_analyzer

# Analyze brand examples
analysis = brand_analyzer.analyze_brand_examples(
    org_id=org_id,
    example_urls=["url1", "url2", "url3"]
)

# Get analysis for generation
brand_aware_prompt = brand_analyzer.get_brand_analysis_for_generation(
    org_id=org_id,
    user_request="Create a product photo"
)
```
