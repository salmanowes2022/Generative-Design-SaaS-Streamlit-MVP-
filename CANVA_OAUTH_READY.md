# Canva OAuth - Ready to Test

## Backend Status
✅ **Single clean backend instance running**
- Backend started with PID: 75212
- Frontend: http://127.0.0.1:3000
- Backend: http://127.0.0.1:3001
- Logs: `/tmp/canva-final.log`

## Verified Working Endpoints
✅ `/authorize` - Returns Canva OAuth URL (302 redirect)
✅ `/oauth/redirect` - OAuth callback endpoint (302 redirect) **NOW WORKING**
✅ `/isauthorized` - Returns "Not Found" before auth (expected)
✅ `/token` - Returns "Unauthorized" before auth (expected)

## Verification Results
✅ `/authorize` endpoint working - redirects to Canva OAuth
✅ `/isauthorized` endpoint responding (returns "Not Found" before auth - expected)
✅ No port conflicts
✅ All previous background processes killed

## Next Steps - Test OAuth Flow

### 1. Start Streamlit App
```bash
cd /Users/salmanawaisa/Desktop/Generative-Design-SaaS-Streamlit-MVP-
streamlit run app/Home.py
```

### 2. Test Connection
1. Open Streamlit app in browser
2. Look for "Connect to Canva" button in sidebar
3. Click the button
4. You'll be redirected to Canva authorization page
5. Click "Connect" on Canva
6. You should see "Successfully authorized!" message
7. Return to Streamlit app
8. Check if connection status shows as connected

### 3. Monitor Backend Logs
```bash
tail -f /tmp/canva-backend-clean.log
```

You should see:
- `GET: /authorize` when clicking "Connect to Canva"
- `GET: /oauth/redirect?code=...` when Canva redirects back
- `Response status 200` on token exchange
- `GET: /success` redirect after successful auth

### 4. Verify Token Persistence
After successful OAuth:
```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3001/isauthorized
# Should return: OK

curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3001/token | head -c 50
# Should return: canva:xxx... (access token)
```

## Important Notes

- **Single Backend Instance**: Only ONE backend is running now. Token will persist correctly.
- **Canva App Configuration**: Verified redirect URI is `http://127.0.0.1:3001/oauth/redirect`
- **Scopes**: Using only enabled scopes (asset:read, design:content:read, design:content:write, design:meta:read, profile:read)

## If Issues Occur

### Backend Not Responding
```bash
# Check backend is still running
ps aux | grep "ts-node.*start" | grep -v grep

# View recent logs
tail -20 /tmp/canva-backend-clean.log
```

### Token Not Persisting
- This was the previous issue caused by multiple backend instances
- Now fixed with single clean instance
- If it happens again, check for duplicate processes

### OAuth Errors
- Check logs: `tail -f /tmp/canva-backend-clean.log`
- Verify Canva app redirect URI: `http://127.0.0.1:3001/oauth/redirect`
- Verify scopes match in Canva app settings

## Success Criteria

✅ Clicking "Connect to Canva" redirects to Canva
✅ Canva authorization completes successfully
✅ Backend logs show "Response status 200" for token exchange
✅ `/isauthorized` returns "OK" after auth
✅ Streamlit app shows "Connected to Canva" status
✅ Token persists across multiple checks

---

**Current Status**: Ready for testing! Backend is running cleanly with no conflicts.
